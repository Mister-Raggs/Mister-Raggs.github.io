## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of fine-tuned large language models for healthcare decision support systems. Using BioBERT as the base model, we developed an intelligent patient routing system that classifies patient cases with high accuracy.

## Key Achievements

- **91.6% accuracy** on 1,000+ test assessments
- **Inference optimization**: Reduced latency from 16s to 5s per request
- **Production-ready**: Deployed on AWS Bedrock with FastAPI
- **Scalable architecture**: Supports high-throughput inference

## Technologies

- BioBERT
- AWS Bedrock
- FastAPI
- PyTorch
