I'm Raghav, a Master's student at UC San Diego with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I'm hungry to learn and equally eager to apply that knowledge to create impact.

## Experience

**AARK Global** – Built and led document processing solutions that modernized workflows for enterprise clients.

**Concentrix** – Developed social media analytics pipelines processing millions of data points in real-time.

**Biomedical Research** – Applied large language models to accelerate research discovery and analysis.

I believe in building fast, learning faster, and iterating better. I'm always open to collaborating on projects that push boundaries and solve meaningful problems.
